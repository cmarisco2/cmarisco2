- 👋 Hi, I’m @cmarisco2 (Christopher for short?)
- 👀 I’m interested in universal accessibility to tech and teachers, being creative and silly, and building tools that aid in these endeavors. Personally enjoy going to my local mma gym and playing board games with my son. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Express Routers & Cookies, Authentication, and Authorization in Web App Development.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that are geared toward granting agency and transparency to users (think Wiki/Academic-Databases/Ad-block) in order to maintain a free and open internet. 
- 📫 Reach Me Primarily via email @ cmarisco2@gmail.com
